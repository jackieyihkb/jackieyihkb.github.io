## Bioinformatics platform construction

- **DeepSeaDB: An integrated genomic DataBase for Deep-Sea species** (Feb. 2023 - Now)

The deep sea is the largest habitat on earth, which covers 71% of the world's surface and is largely unexplored yet. [**DeepSeaDB**](http://143.89.25.9/DeepSeaDB/) is the most comprehensive genomic DataBase specifically for Deep-Sea species. It integrated vast genomic resources and offered functional support toolkits for multi-dimensional analysis. DeepSeaDB will be a comprehensive one-stop genomic platform for Deep-sea researchers, by providing support for conducting comprehensive investigations on the continuously expanding deep-sea genomic data and thus promote Deep-sea research on the diversity and adaptability.

- **Tomato multi-omics data analysis platform** (Aug. 2016 - Oct. 2019)
Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), the second most important vegetable crop in the world, is also an important model plant for the study of fruit ripening and disease resistance. However, the function of tomato genes remains largely unknown. We integrated multi-omics data to offer invaluable insights into the intricate web of biological interactions and presented the Tomato multi-omics data Analysis Platform, [**TomAP**](http://bioinformatics.cau.edu.cn/TomAP/) [Cao, **She** et al., 2024](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ncrops.2023.10.001). The co-expression network and the defined chromatin states open up a realm of possibilities, not only for investigating the commonalities and variations among co-expressed genes in the context of chromatin states but also for comparative functional assessments of orthologs across species. 

-  **Catharanthus roseus Functional Genomics Database** (Jun. 2017 - Jun. 2019)
Catharanthus roseus (L.) G. Don, a medicinal plant, produces monoterpene indole alkaloids (MIAs) derived from secologanin and tryptamine. Based on transcriptomic data sets, we constructed co-expression network and performed further analysis, such as network search, network comparison and network analysis. The information of gene family, KEGG pathway, GO terms and miRNA was integrated into [**croFGD**](http://bioinformatics.cau.edu.cn/croFGD/) database [**She** et al., 2019](https://doi.org/10.3389/fgene.2019.00238).

-  **Maintenance and upgrading of Plant Non-coding RNA Database** (Nov. 2015 - Jun. 2020)
Based on the [**PNRD**](http://structuralbiology.cau.edu.cn/PNRD/) database [Yi et al., 2014](https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gku1162), we collected a total of 924,127 entries of 14 different types of ncRNAs from 221 plant species. Targets of miRNAs were extended to 900,771 pairs in 57 species, and the number of miRNA expression profiles reached 142 in 47 species.
 
## Deep-sea evolution and metabolic interaction between host and symbionts 
Prior studies on specific adaptation to the hostile deep-sea conditions has predominantly centered on selected deep-sea species or mitochondrial genomes. However, there has yet to be a systematic investigation of distinctive adaptations across a wide range of deep-sea species based on available genomes. Phylogenetic analysis for deep-sea and shallow-water species showed that these deep-sea species diverged more than 300 million years ago. Positive selection genes (PSGs) including heat shock proteins (HSPs), transporter protein (ABC transporter, amino acid transporter), transmembrane pattern-recognition receptor (PRR), were beneficial for deep-sea organisms to obtain their symbionts from the environment.

## Epitranscriptomic in reproductive diseases and deep-sea organisms
We performed high-throughput sequencing in villous tissues from spontaneous abortion (SA group) and controls with induced abortion (normal group) in the first trimester, and mapped the profiles of m6A modification in human villi with early spontaneous abortion. Based on the conjoint analysis of meRIP-seq and RNA-seq data, we identified key candidate genes involved in early spontaneous abortion. Finally, we explored the mechanism through focusing on the key gene IGFBP3 (insulin-like growth factor binding protein) and C/EBPÎ² (endometrial receptivity marker) [**She** et al., 2020](https://doi.org/10.3389/fgene.2022.861853). 

## Machine learning application in the diagnosis of Endometriosis
Combining with random forest and artificial neural network, we identified seven important differentially expressed genes (DEGs) for the diagnosis of Endometriosis and verified its diagnostic efficacy in public datasets. The diagnostic model can provide novel sights into the understanding of the pathogenesis of EMs and contribute to the clinical diagnosis and treatment of EMs (She et al., 2020)(https://doi.org/10.3389/fgene.2022.848116).
