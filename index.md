### About me

I hold a PhD degree on Bioinformatics (China Agricultural University, Beijing, China, 2015-2020). And then, i continued to be a Postdoctoral Researcher at Shenzhen Second People's Hospital (2020-2023) and received a Grant from the Science and Technology Innovation Committee of Shenzhen. Now, i'm a joint Postdoctoral Researcher (GML Supervisor: Prof. Pei-yuan Qian, HKUST Supervisor: Prof. Longjun Wu) from Joint Postdoctoral Training Program launched by GML and HKB.

Outside of my academic life, i'm interested in traveling and sports, like badminton, table tennis, hiking. Now, i'm learning to play tennis and continue swimming.
