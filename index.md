### About me

I hold a PhD degree on **Bioinformatics** (China Agricultural University, Beijing, China, **2015-2020**). And then, i continued to be a **Postdoctoral Researcher** at Shenzhen Second People's Hospital (**2020-2023**) and received a Grant from the Science and Technology Innovation Committee of Shenzhen. Now, i'm a **joint Postdoctoral Researcher** (GML Supervisor: Prof. Pei-yuan Qian, HKUST Supervisor: Prof. Longjun Wu) from Joint Postdoctoral Training Program launched by GML and HKB.

Outside of my academic life, i'm interested in **traveling and sports**, like badminton, table tennis, hiking. Now, i'm learning to play tennis and continue swimming.
