    excerpt: The deep sea is the largest habitat on earth, which covers 71% of the world's surface and is largely unexplored yet. [**DeepSeaDB**](http://143.89.25.9/DeepSeaDB/) is the most comprehensive genomic DataBase specifically for Deep-Sea species. It integrated vast genomic resources and offered functional support toolkits for multi-dimensional analysis.

    excerpt: Tomato is an important model plant for the study of fruit ripening and disease resistance, but the gene function remains largely unknown. We integrated multi-omics data to offer invaluable insights into the intricate web of biological interactions and presented the Tomato multi-omics data Analysis Platform.

    excerpt: Paeonia lactiflora Pall., commonly known as the herbaceous peony, is an ornamental flowering plant known around the world. We produced 40 in-house RNA-seq datasets from 10 different tissues and performed de novo transcriptome assembly to obtain a complete transcriptome. Moreover,we had constructed the co-expression network database.

    excerpt: Catharanthus roseus (L.) G. Don, a medicinal plant, produces monoterpene indole alkaloids (MIAs) derived from secologanin and tryptamine. Based on transcriptomic data sets, we constructed co-expression network and performed network search, network comparison and network analysis. The information of gene family, KEGG pathway, GO terms and miRNA was integrated into the database.

    excerpt: Based on the PNRD database, we collected a total of 924,127 entries of 14 different types of ncRNAs from 221 plant species. Targets of miRNAs were extended to 900,771 pairs in 57 species, and the number of miRNA expression profiles reached 142 in 47 species.
